# Skill based heterogenous Robotic system

## Various skills the robots posses

1. Communication
2. Laser Light
3. Odometery
4. Pushing power
5. Gripper
6. Camera
----
## Every robot has a limited power (battery). There are also charging stations.
----
## Different types of robots and the skills they possess.

### 1. Robot
Skill sets = <s1, s6> (Communication and Camera) - a perfect spotter
### 2. Robot
Skill sets = <s1, s4> (Communication and Pushing power ) - work horse
### 3. Robot
Skill sets = <s1, s4, s5> (Communication, Pushing power, Gripper) - Specific worker
### 4. Robot
Skill sets = <s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6> (All round performance)

## Types of tasks
There are different tasks to be accomplished by the heterogenous systems. The objects available in the arena are given below
1. Wooden table
2. Wooden log
3. Glass table
4. Almirah
 
To move each of the above mentioned items in their required place we need robots with different types of skills. Thus the heterogenous system mentioned above will come handy

## Spotter
<center>
A robot with camera and Communication skill can spot these tasks and discover the skills required for completing the found tasks and calls robots with required robots to complete the tasks. Instead of using all the robots with all their skills we can use robots with simple camera and communication to do the job.</center>

<center>
This is a simple robot with just a camera and communication devices. It spots tasks and hast to call the robots with required tasks.
